Author´s notes for interview purposes

1) placeZeroesToEnd - I went for easy readability, it should not affect performance too much here.
2) isPalindrome - On the contrary of 1), I couldn´t come up with easy-to-read solution that would  
  on average perform similary to "ugly" code, so I stuck with it.
3) matrix - I am pretty much happy wiht this
